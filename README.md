# Data Warehouse Analysis

## Project Statement
The purpose of our project is to partner with Data Sleek to analyze the data in their data warehouse using Snowflake, design KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that are easy to analyze, and produce interactive dashboards in Tableau. The scope of our project is to identify relevant data sources from QuickBooks in the DS data warehouse, analyze the data using SQL queries, design and execute KPIs that align with the business objectives, and create a dynamic dashboard that showcases these KPIs clearly and concisely. The Tableau dashboard will display real-time data and can be customized to meet the needs of different departments and stakeholders in DS.
